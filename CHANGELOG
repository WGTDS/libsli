    Change Log:

    [2023/07/31]
        Updated Revision [v1.02]
            [Fixes]
                Corrected an erroneous solution involving memcpy() in
                the decoding function for back-copying.
            [Support]
                + SMSR00
                + Yaz0
            [Notes]
                Support for SMSR00 and Yaz0 have been restored.
                However, the former no longer follows the formatting
                observed in Yoshi's Story - being a 16-Byte prefix
                header denoting a FourCC, size of the Compressed
                Block, size of the Decompressed Block, and an unused
                32-bit section.

    [2023/07/17]
        Updated Revision [v1.01]
            [Support]
                - SMSR00
                - Yaz0
                + Rvl0
            [Notes]
                After nearly two years of neglect, this software
                has recevied an overhaul in terms of convenience,
                as well as, addressing some issues that crept
                into the accuracy of encoded data header info.

                On the other hand, support for the SMSR00 and Yaz0
                formats have been removed for the time being while
                the addition of an unofficial format, Rvl0, has
                been included in this revision.

                SMSR00 is a unique format that's only used in one
                game whereas Yaz0 has seen use since the days of
                Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, and Animal Forest -
                the latter format being an interleaved variation
                of Yay0.

    [2021/11/27]
        Initial Revision [v1.00]
            [Support]
                + MIO0
                + SMSR00
                + Yay0
                + Yaz0
